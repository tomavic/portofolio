        My current focus is on JavaScript and Python. I love reading and
        thinking about programming patterns, so I have decided to write about it
        everyday!

        <strong class="text-decoration-underline">#CodeWithMeNow</strong> is a
        web development blog that provides tutorials, techniques and code
        snippets. The web is an innovating world. The pace of new techniques to
        build and improve websites keeps on accelerating. My goal is to share
        some of that knowledge.
